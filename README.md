# Alexa Tomato Helper

Thie is an unofficial skill of the Pomodoro Technique. It is a timer that allows the user to work for 25 minutes and then rest for five minutes. Such a pattern boosts productivity and minimizes distraction. After saying, "Alexa, start tomato helper," followed by "Start," there will be a 25-minute countdown. After 25 minutes, the alarm will ring to notify the user that it is time for a break. The user should say, "Alexa, next," to stop the alarm and start the break. After the break, the user should say, "Alexa, next," to start the next 25 minutes of work. After four 25-minute periods, there will be a longer break of 20 minutes.
