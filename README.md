# Alexa Tomato Helper

Thie is an unofficial skill of the Pomodoro Technique. It is a timer which allows the user to work for 25 minutes then rest for 5 minutes. Such a pattern boosts productivity and minimizes distraction. After saying "Alexa, start tomato helper", followed by "start", there will be a 25-minute count-down. After 25 minutes, the alarm will ring to notify the user that it is time for a break. The user should say "Alexa, next" to stop the alarm and start the break. After the break, the user should say "Alexa, next" to start the next 25-minute of work. After 4 25-minute periods, there will be a longer break of 20 minutes.
